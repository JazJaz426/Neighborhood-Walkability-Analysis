## Neighborhood-Walkability-Analysis

In this project I gathered and integrated several datasets to perform a data analysis of the walkability of different neighbourhoods in Sydney. More specifically, I
* Built a database that integrates the web-scraping and cencus data using spatial join and indexing.
* Calculated the walkability score for different Sydney neighborhoods.
* Performed correlation analysis between walkability score and neighborhood average rent/income.
