This is the group assignment of DATA2001 and in this assignment I gathered and integrated several datasets to perform a data analysis of the walkability of different neighbourhoods in Sydney. 
1. Built a database that integrates the web-scraping and cencus data using spatial join and indexing.
2. Calculated the walkability score for different Sydney neighborhoods.
3. Performed correlation analysis between walkability score and neighborhood average rent/income.
